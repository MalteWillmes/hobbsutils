\title{Convert measured Strontium ratio to salinity

}
\description{
This function calculates salinity from measured Sr using a 2 end member mixing model. It requires the measured Sr ratio, Endmember 1 Strontium, Endmember 2 Strontium, concentrations for each, and salinity of the two endmembers. Default values only correct for Sacramento Delta
}
\usage{
sr_2_sal(sr, srfw = 0.705781, srmar = 0.70918, confw = 103.8, conmar = 7900, salfw = 0.1, salmar = 31.8)

}

\arguments{
  \item{sr}{Measured strontium. Should be giving as the ratio of Sr87/Sr86.}
  \item{srfw}{Strontium ratio of freshwater (or endmember 1).}
  \item{srmar}{Strontium ratio of the ocean (or endmember 2).}
  \item{confw}{Concentation (parts per million) of Strontium in freshwater (or endmember 1).}
  \item{conmar}{Concentration (parts per million) of Strontium in the ocean (or endmember 2).}
  \item{salfw}{Salinity of freshwater (or endmember 1).}
  \item{salmar}{Salinity of the ocean (or endmember 2).}
