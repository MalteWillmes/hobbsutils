\title{Convert measured Strontium ratio to salinity

}
\description{
This function calculates salinity from measured Sr using a 2 end member mixing model. It requires the measured Sr ratio, Endmember 1 Strontium, Endmember 2 Strontium, concentrations for each, and salinity of the two endmembers. Default values only correct for Sacramento Delta
}
\usage{
sr_2_sal(sr, srfw = 0.705781, srmar = 0.70918, confw = 103.8, conmar = 7900, salfw = 0.1, salmar = 31.8)

}

\arguments{
  \item{sr}{Measured strontium. Should be giving as the ratio of Sr87/Sr86.}
  \item{srfw}{Strontium ratio of freshwater (or endmember 1).}
  \item{srmar}{Strontium ratio of the ocean (or endmember 2).}
  \item{confw}{Concentation (parts per million) of Strontium in freshwater (or endmember 1).}
  \item{conmar}{Concentration (parts per million) of Strontium in the ocean (or endmember 2).}
  \item{salfw}{Salinity of freshwater (or endmember 1).}
  \item{salmar}{Salinity of the ocean (or endmember 2).}
  \item{sallim}{Limit of ability to accurately distinguish different salinities.}
  \item{fill}{what to replace calculated values that exceed the sallim value (e.g. "NA" or 7).}

%%  If it is a LIST, use

%%  \item{sr }{If the Sr value is more than the machine error rate (of the ICPMS machine used at UC DAVIS) outside of the srfw and srmar values, it will be returned as NA. }
    \item{sallim}{The user designated salinity resolution limit. Calculated sainities above this value will be replaced by the fill argument}
    \item{fill }{Fill argument excepts either "NA" or "sallim". If NA, values above the sallim will be replaced with NA. If "sallim", valuese above the sallim with be replaced with the sallim. }
